If you have any questions before opening the .bat file
Feel free to go to the resources folder to check that it's not a malicious game.

The game uses JavaScript and runs in your default browser because it's an HTML file.

You're also free to use any virus detection software.

Finally, thank you so much for downloading/playing my game <3
